# Documentation rules

Repo-level documentation rules the procoder harness reads and follows. Edit
freely — what is written here wins over the built-in defaults. The three list
sections below are machine-read (one `- item` per line); everything else is
guidance for the agent.

## Required docs

- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md

## Required badges

- ci
- license

## README first screen

- usp
- badges
- quick start

## Version-tracked docs

- README.md
- docs/index.md

## README must mention

## Guidance

### Four kinds of document, never mixed

Documentation is not one thing; it is four, and a page trying to be two of
them serves neither. This is the Divio documentation system
(https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/). Decide which one you are
writing BEFORE the first line, and let the page's opening sentence say so.

| Kind | Serves | Answers | Form |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tutorial | a newcomer learning | "teach me" | a lesson that must succeed end to end |
| How-to guide | a competent user working | "how do I X?" | numbered steps toward one stated goal |
| Reference | someone looking a thing up | "what are the options?" | flat, complete, boring description |
| Explanation | someone wanting to understand | "why is it like this?" | prose on context and trade-offs |

The failures are predictable, and each is a real page someone abandoned:

- A tutorial that stops to explain trade-offs loses the learner. Explain
  later — the lesson only has to work.
- A how-to that teaches from scratch wastes a reader who already knows.
  Assume competence; put the goal in the title.
- Reference that argues for an approach cannot be trusted to describe it.
  Describe, never persuade.
- Explanation carrying steps rots, because the steps then live in two
  places. Link to the how-to.

A tutorial must run exactly as written on a clean machine. A reference must
cover everything, not the interesting parts.

### Writing craft

- Answer first. Open every section with the command or the fact; context
  comes after it, never before.
- Show rather than tell. A copy-pasteable example beats a paragraph about
  one. Prose has to earn its space; working code already has.
- Real data. `payments-api`, `POSTGRES_URL`, `checkout_total` — never foo, bar,
  baz. Placeholder names hide the shape of real input.
- Short sentences, under fifteen words where the meaning allows. One idea
  each.
- Scannable: subheadings, bullets, bold on the term the eye should land on.
  Readers scan before they read.
- Findable: name a feature the way a reader searches for it, and give the
  synonym they might use instead — "the write hook (PostToolUse)".
- Say the don'ts. Where a feature has a common misuse, a short "Common
  pitfalls" list is worth three paragraphs of careful prose.

### Diagrams

A diagram earns its place by showing something the prose cannot: a shape,
a loop, an order, a place where the flow can turn back. A picture of a
bulleted list is decoration.

- Mermaid, always — it renders on GitHub and in the docs site, and
  `procoder docs` compiles every diagram and blocks on one that does not.
- Let the theme carry colour and let shape carry meaning: rounded for a
  start or end, rectangle for a step, diamond for something that decides,
  parallelogram for a note. Hard-coded fills cannot follow a reader who
  switches to dark mode.
- Prefer `TD` when the flow has branches or returns, `LR` when it is a
  short pipeline. A wide `LR` chart with many nodes compresses its labels
  to nothing.
- Say in one line what the reader should take from it, above the diagram.
- Look at it rendered before calling it done. A build that passes and an
  assertion that returns true both report on what the code says, not on
  what a reader sees. For anything visual — a diagram, a table, CSS,
  client-side behaviour — open the page, in both colour schemes where
  the site has two. When the assertion and the screenshot disagree, the
  screenshot is right.

### Mechanics

The README's first screen must sell the project: lead with the one-line value
proposition, then badges, then a quick start a stranger can paste. The
shared diagram theme lives in .procoder/docs/mermaid.json. Broken relative
links and diagrams that do not compile are blocking; external links are verified by
`procoder docs --external` and CI — never skipped, never in the write hook.
Keep CHANGELOG.md current: every release gets an entry a user can read.
