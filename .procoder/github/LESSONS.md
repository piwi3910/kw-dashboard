# Lessons — findings that escaped our own gates

One entry per finding caught downstream (bot review, human review,
production) — the escape is the bug; the finding is its symptom. Every
entry names which layer should have caught it and the adaptation that now
does. `procoder lessons` flags entries with no adaptation.

Entry shape (unindented in real entries):

    ## <date> <where caught> — <one-line finding>

    - Class: mechanical | judgment | taste
    - Missed by: linter | rubric | controller | test | ci
    - Adaptation: <the concrete change that catches this class from now on>
