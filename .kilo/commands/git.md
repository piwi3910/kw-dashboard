description: "The pre-finish status: branch, hygiene findings, message checks, workflow lint, template state."

The user invoked /procoder:git.

Run:

    procoder git

Read the whole report and act on it:

- BLOCK lines are yours to fix before the work is finished: remove conflict
  markers, unstage junk files, deal with oversized files, amend any commit
  message carrying an AI-attribution line (the work is the author's — never
  add Co-Authored-By or "generated with" lines, here or anywhere).
- info lines are judgment calls: address them or explain to the user why not.
- If a template is missing, run `procoder templates`, review the printed
  content, write the files under .procoder/github/, and register the commit
  template with the printed git config command.
- Working on the default branch is information by default; if the user's flow
  is branch-based, offer to create a branch.

Finish by re-running the command and showing the user the clean report.
