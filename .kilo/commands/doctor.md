description: Report which formatters this repository needs, which are installed, and how to install the rest.

The user invoked /procoder:doctor.

Run:

    procoder doctor

Show the user the result. For every line marked GAP, suggest /procoder:init,
which installs the missing tools with every command visible. Files of a type whose formatter is missing are reported as
unchecked by the gate — never as clean — so a GAP is a hole in the gate, not a
cosmetic issue.
