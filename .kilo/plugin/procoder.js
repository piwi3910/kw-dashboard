// Server plugin for procoder, shared by OpenCode and Kilo: injects the
// AGENTS.md contract into every turn, registers the command set, and holds
// the commit gate at the tool boundary. Kilo's CLI is an OpenCode fork and
// its plugin API is the same one, so this file ships byte-identical to both
// `.opencode/plugins/procoder.mjs` and `.kilo/plugin/procoder.js` (the two
// hosts scan different extensions); the parity test pins them together.
//
// This shim is the one piece of non-Go glue in the repo — plugins must be JS
// — and it stays thin: all content comes from AGENTS.md and the command
// directory, and every gate decision comes from the binary.
